This directory contains the data and code used in the main simulation study.

data/: Contains the gene conversion tracts detected from 20 genomic regions simulated in 125,000 individuals using msprime.

fit.model.py: Runs the statistical method to model the length distribution of the detected tracts for each simulated region.

logs/: Contains log files generated from running fit.model.py.

results/: Contains the output from the modeling process, as well as the R Markdown (.Rmd) file used to analyze and summarize the results.

To run the model fitting, use:
for seed in {1..20}; do
    python3 fit.model.py $seed
done
