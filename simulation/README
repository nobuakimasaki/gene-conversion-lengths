This directory contains the data and code used in the main simulation study.

data/: Contains the gene converison tracts detected from the 20 regions in 125,000 individuals simulated using msprime. 

fit.model.py: Runs the statistical method to model the length distribution of these detected tracts.

logs/: Generated from running fit.model.py

results/: Contains the output generated by running the code, as well as the R Markdown file (.Rmd) used to analyze and summarize the results.

To run fit.model.py, use:
for seed in {1..20}; do
    python3 fit.model.py $seed
done
