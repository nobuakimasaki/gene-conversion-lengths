This directory contains the data and code used in the stratified analysis of detected gene conversion tracts from the UK Biobank whole-autosome sequence data (stratifying by crossover-hotspot overlap).

hotspot_detection/: Contains the DECODE genetic map and the R code used to define crossover hotspots.

code/: Contains the code used to model the gene conversion tract length distribution in both sets of tracts.

results/: Contains the output generated by running the code, as well as the R Markdown file (.Rmd) used to analyze and summarize the results.
