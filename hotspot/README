This directory contains the data and code used in the stratified analysis of detected gene conversion tracts from the UK Biobank whole-autosome sequence data, stratified by whether the tracts overlap crossover recombination hotspots.

hotspot_detection/: Contains the deCODE genetic map and the R code used to define crossover hotspots based on local recombination rates.

code/: Contains the code used to model the gene conversion tract length distribution separately for tracts that do and do not overlap crossover hotspots.

results/: Contains the output generated by running the analysis code, as well as the R Markdown (.Rmd) file used to summarize and visualize the results.
