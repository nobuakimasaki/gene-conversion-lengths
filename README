This repository contains the code and data associated with the study:
“Modeling the length distribution of gene conversion tracts in humans from the UK Biobank sequence data.”

Each directory corresponds to a distinct section of the paper and contains the relevant data and code used in the analysis.

UK_Biobank/: Contains the genomic positions of 5,961,128 detected gene conversion tracts from the UK Biobank whole-autosome sequence data, along with the code used to perform the UK Biobank analysis.

hotspot/: Contains the code used for the stratified analysis of detected gene conversion tracts based on their overlap with crossover hotspots.

simulation/: Contains the simulated data and code for the coalescent simulation study used to evaluate the performance of the modeling framework.

robustness_sim/: Contains the simulated data and code for the robustness study, assessing how well the method performs under model misspecification.

supplementary/: Contains the code used to generate the supplementary results on how linkage disequilibrium affects the distribution of observed gene conversion tract lengths.
