This repository includes the code and data used for the study, "Modeling the length distribution of gene conversion tracts in humans from the UK Biobank sequence data."

Each file contains code and data for a different section of the paper.

The UK_Biobank/ directory contains the genomic positions of 5,961,128 detected gene conversion tracts from the UK Biobank whole-autosome sequence data, along with the code used to perform the UK Biobank analysis. The hotspot/ directory contains the code for the analysis stratifying detected gene conversion tracts by whether they overlapped a crossover hotspot.

The simulation/ directory contains the simulated data and code used in the coalescent simulation study. The robustness_sim/ directory contains the simulated data and code in the simulation study used to assess the robustness of the method.

The supplementary/ directory contains the code used for the remaining supplementary information files on how linkage disequilibrium affects the length distribution of observed gene conversion tracts.
