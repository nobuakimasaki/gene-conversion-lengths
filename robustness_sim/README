This directory contains the code and data used to run the simulation study described in the Appendix. In this simulation, gene conversion tracts are simulated on individuals generated using the first seed of a coalescent simulation performed with msprime. The simulated tracts are then used to evaluate the performance of the tract length modeling method.

data/: Contains the .vcf files representing the genotypes of individuals generated using msprime, as well as the minor allele frequencies of the simulated genomic region.

sim_tracts/: Contains the Python scripts used to simulate observed gene conversion tracts based on the .vcf files. This directory also includes the resulting simulated tracts generated under each assumed distribution of gene conversion tract lengths.

code/: Contains the R code used to fit the length distribution model to the simulated observed tracts.

results/: Contains the output generated by running the analysis code, as well as the R Markdown (.Rmd) file used to summarize and visualize the results.
