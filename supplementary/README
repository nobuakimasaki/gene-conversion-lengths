This directory contains the code and data used to generate the supplementary analyses and figures included in the Supplementary Materials of the paper.

sim_tracts/: Contains sim_tracts.R, which simulates observed gene conversion tracts using minor allele frequencies from Chromosome 1 of the UK Biobank sequence data.

Note: Due to data access restrictions, the minor allele frequencies used for this simulation are not included in the public repository.
The resulting simulated tracts are saved in res.geom.rds.

l_psi/: Contains calculate_l_psi_sim.py, which computes the observed tract lengths and the estimated allele conversion probabilities (l_psi) from the coalescent simulation. The output is saved in l_psi_sim.csv.

analysis.Rmd: An R Markdown file used to compare the observed tract length distributions from both simulations with the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the model. This script generates the supplementary figures related to these comparisons.
